# Song of Syx - Shapes

For Song of Syx V66.

1) Added hollow ellipse shape. Size can be altered as normal.
2) Pressing the MOD key (ctrl by default) will force the ellipses and hollow ellipses to be circles instead.
3) Ellipse and hollow ellipse now grow from the starting point. The starting point will be the center.
